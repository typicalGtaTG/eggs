# Eggs
Simple Eggs and scripts for Pterodactyl Panel. These eggs mostly use docker images that are not made by me and I, in no way take any credit for it. These eggs are for my personal records and use, Anyone wanting, can use these scirpts as long as credits are given to their rightful owners (includes me, creators of the images used and any other developers involved in several aspects of the script itself.) and without any modification.
